Concatenate 1171a and 1171b after denoising; update metadata file for QIIME to reflect update in SampleID. These two samples were biological replicates.
We can do this within QIIME, if desired: https://forum.qiime2.org/t/merging-feature-tables/2326/4

P7-1
Don't need to concatenate samples 3572 because only one of two amplified (just 3572a amplified; there is no 3572b).
Likewise, sample 2556a has no replicate with sequence data.
